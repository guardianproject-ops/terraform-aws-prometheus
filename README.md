## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-prometheus/releases).



```hcl
module "monitoring" {
  source          = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-prometheus.git?ref=tags/0.1.0"

  namespace       = var.namespace
  name            = var.name
  stage           = var.stage
  delimiter       = var.delimiter
  attributes      = ["matrix-alertmanager"]
  tags            = var.tags

  playbook_bundle_s3_key = var.playbook_bundle_s3_key
  playbook_bucket        = var.playbook_bucket
  ssm_logs_bucket        = var.ssm_logs_bucket
  vpc_id                 = var.vpc_id
  subnet_id              = var.subnet_id
  ami                    = var.ami
  instance_type          = var.instance_type
  az                     = var.az
}
